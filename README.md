# <p align="center">FlickR API Photo Gallery - PROJECT 7</p>

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The React Gallery is an app built using ReactJS. It allows a use to explore the many photographs hosted by Flickr using their API. There are three default search categories which can be selected using the buttons or a user can enter any other topic to search the Flickr database and render up to 24 random pictures. 

# ** IMPORTANT !! **

The app needs to reach out to the Flicker API to perform the search and return the photographs. In order to allow this functionality the app needs to use an API KEY which is assigned to verified user. Due to the sensitive nature of the API KEY it is installed in a config file which is not included in this repository. In order to use this APP you need to:

<ol>
<li> Register with Flicker to get an API Key Assigned</li>
<li> Create a new file called "config.js" in the "src" folder</li>
<li> In the file add :</li>
    
    > const apiKey = 'ENTER YOUR KEY HERE';
    > export default apiKey;
     
</ol>

The app should be able to access the API and return the images after adding this file.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
